## Definition

The London Judas swing is the canonical session-open Judas — the deceptive directional move at the start of London (02:00 NY) that sweeps the [asian-range](../14-asian-range/asian-range.md) on the wrong side before the algorithm reverses and delivers the true HTF-bias-aligned move. This is the most-frequent Judas pattern in ICT's framework and the highest-quality version because the Asian range is a clean, well-defined liquidity setup overnight.

**Why this window specifically:** a 2026 community source frames the 00:00–05:00 NY window as existing because three sessions' open/close times cluster there — NY midnight is the [TDO](../22-quarterly-theory/true-day-open.md) / IPDA daily reset (the algorithmic start of the new trading day), shortly followed by the London market open, with the Tokyo/Asian session close also falling in the same stretch. The source's own clock figures for the London-open and Tokyo-close components are internally inconsistent with its own later "02:00–05:00" statement (p.275 vs p.278) and are treated as a transcription artifact, not cited — the causal claim (three session boundaries overlapping is *why* this window is Judas-prone) is the substantive contribution, independent of the exact minute figures.

## Formal Criteria

- Killzone: London Open KZ (02:00–05:00 NY).
- Sweep target: Asian range high (high-side Judas) or low (low-side Judas).
- Macro overlap: 02:50–03:10 NY macro window often contains the sweep.
- Reversal: occurs in the same killzone, displaces, leaves an FVG.
- Direction post-reversal: aligns with HTF bias.
- Entry array: usually a fresh FVG, but a 2026 community source's worked examples use an [inversion-fvg](../06-fair-value-gaps/inversion-fvg.md) (iFVG) on the M15 entry TF as often as a plain FVG — treat both as valid Internal Range Liquidity entry references alongside Order Block and Liquidity Void.

## Formula / Math

```
london_judas := session == London_Open_KZ [02:00, 05:00] NY
                 AND sweeps(asian_range_high) OR sweeps(asian_range_low)
                 AND reverses_in_kz == true
                 AND reversal_aligns_with_HTF_bias == true
```

## Visual Pattern

```
   00:00 ── 02:00 ── 03:00 ── 05:00 NY
              |      |        |
   asian_high ──────────────  ← swept here on high-side Judas
              ↑
              ↑  initial Judas-up
              ↑  (FAKE direction, often
              ↑   first ~30 min of KZ)
              │
              ↓  reversal down
              ↓  displacement + FVG
              ↓
   asian_low  ──────────────
                 ↑
                 ↑ (low-side Judas variant
                    swept here, then reversal up)
```

## Timeframes

M1 / M5 / M15.

## Examples

**Example 1 — bullish HTF, low-side Judas:**
- HTF bullish; Asian range 1.0848–1.0876.
- 02:25 NY: M5 wicks 1.0846 (Asian SSL swept), closes 1.0852.
- 02:55–03:10 (macro): M5 prints 18-pip green displacement; FVG at 1.0858–1.0862.
- 03:20: pulls back to FVG; long entry.
- 04:30: 1.0905 reached (PDH).
- → textbook bullish-aligned London Judas.

**Example 2 — bearish HTF, high-side Judas:**
- HTF bearish; Asian range 1.0848–1.0876.
- 02:30 NY: M5 wicks 1.0879 (Asian BSL swept), closes 1.0871.
- 03:00 (macro): M5 prints 16-pip red displacement; FVG at 1.0867–1.0863.
- 03:25: pulls back to FVG; short entry.
- 05:00: 1.0840 reached.
- → textbook bearish-aligned London Judas.

## Common Mistakes

- **Trading both sides.** The Judas is one direction; pick the side based on HTF bias and don't fade your own bias when the fake-out comes through.
- **Late entry on extended displacement.** If displacement extends 30+ pips before retracing to FVG, the FVG often holds but the R:R degrades.
- **Wrong macro alignment.** A Judas that sweeps before 02:50 (pre-macro) sometimes plays out cleaner; one that hasn't swept by 03:30 may not be a Judas at all — could be direct delivery.
