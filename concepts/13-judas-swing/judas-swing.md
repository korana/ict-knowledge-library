## Definition

A Judas swing is the **deceptive opening move at the start of a session** that goes in the opposite direction of the session's true intended delivery. Named for the New Testament betrayal — the move "betrays" inattentive traders into committing to the wrong direction before the algorithm reverses and runs the actual delivery. The Judas swing is ICT's name for the manipulation phase ([manipulation-phase](../12-power-of-three/manipulation-phase.md)) at the session-open scale. It is most commonly observed at the London open ([london-judas-swing](london-judas-swing.md)) but also appears at the NY AM open ([ny-judas-swing](ny-judas-swing.md)).

## Formal Criteria

A canonical Judas swing requires:

- A session open with a clear directional move in the **first 15–60 minutes** of the killzone.
- That directional move sweeps a known liquidity pool (typically the prior session's range bound — Asian range high/low for London Judas; lunch range or NY AM range for NY-PM Judas).
- A **reversal** within the same killzone in the opposite direction.
- The reversal usually displaces and leaves a fair value gap that becomes the entry zone.
- The reversal direction aligns with HTF bias (the actual draw on liquidity).

## Formula / Math

```
judas_swing(session) :=
  initial_move_direction = direction(open of KZ -> first 15-60 min)
  swept_liquidity        = pool taken during initial_move
  reversal_direction     = opposite of initial_move_direction
  reversal_aligns_with_HTF_bias == true
  displacement_after_reversal == true
  fvg_in_reversal == true
```

## Visual Pattern

```
   session_open
       │
       ↓
       █  Judas swing (initial fakeout direction)
       █
       █  ← sweeps prior pool
   ────█──── (e.g. asian_low)
                          ↑
                          █  reversal back through range
                          █  (true direction = HTF bias)
                          █  + FVG inside
                          █
                          → continues to HTF DOL
```

## Timeframes

M1 / M5 / M15 — the Judas itself usually plays out in the first 15–60 minutes of the killzone.

## Examples

**Example 1 — bullish-bias London Judas:**
- HTF bias bullish; Asian range 1.0848–1.0876.
- 02:30 NY (LO-KZ): M5 wicks 1.0846 (Asian SSL swept), closes 1.0853.
- 02:55–03:10 (macro): M5 displaces 18 pips up, FVG at 1.0858–1.0862.
- 03:20: returns to FVG; long entry triggered.
- 04:30: takes 1.0900 PDH BSL.
- → textbook Judas: down-then-up matching HTF bullish bias.

## Common Mistakes

- **Trading the Judas direction itself.** The Judas IS the trap; you're meant to enter on the *reversal*, not the initial fakeout.
- **No bias filter.** A Judas swing without HTF bias confirmation is just chop. The reversal direction MUST agree with HTF.
- **Wrong session.** Judas usually means "London open Judas." NY AM has a smaller-scale Judas; PM session sometimes has a lunch-Judas. Specify which.
- **Late identification.** By the time the Judas + reversal + FVG are all visible, the high-conviction entry window may have closed; entries on FVG retest are the standard play.
- **Treating "Judas Swing" and "Turtle Soup" as different patterns.** A 2026 community source states they're the same underlying sweep-and-reverse behavior — the name used depends only on whether the sweep falls inside this file's 02:00–05:00 NY timing window (Judas Swing) or occurs elsewhere/on a non-session-anchored setup ([turtle-soup](../20-turtle-soup/turtle-soup.md)).
