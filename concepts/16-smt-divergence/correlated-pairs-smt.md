## Definition

Correlated-pairs SMT is the application of SMT divergence to **FX pair pairings** that share a common currency leg. The most-cited pairings: **EURUSD vs GBPUSD** (both have USD as quote, both broadly track European-USD strength), **AUDUSD vs NZDUSD** (Aussie pairing), **USDJPY vs USDCHF** (USD-base pairs). The shared currency leg means the pairs move similarly but rarely identically — the divergences ICT teaches as actionable usually occur at extreme price levels (tested SSL/BSL pools).

## Formal Criteria

A correlated-pair SMT requires:

- Two FX pairs (or, per a 2026 community source, any other strongly correlated instrument pair — e.g. BTC/ETH) with **strong positive correlation** (typical: EUR vs GBP majors, AUD vs NZD, USD-bases, etc.).
- Both pairs are reaching a known structural level (sweep, swing extreme).
- One pair confirms (makes new high/low); the other fails to confirm (lower high or higher low).
- Confirmation requires inspecting the **same time-of-day candle** on both charts (don't compare 09:00 EURUSD with 10:00 GBPUSD).

## Formula / Math

```
positive_correlation_pair = (asset_A, asset_B) where corr_60d > 0.7

bullish_smt(asset_A, asset_B, t):
    A.low_at(t) < A.prior_low_in_session
    AND B.low_at(t) > B.prior_low_in_session     # divergence

bearish_smt(asset_A, asset_B, t):
    A.high_at(t) > A.prior_high_in_session
    AND B.high_at(t) < B.prior_high_in_session
```

## Visual Pattern

Same as [smt-divergence](smt-divergence.md) — two charts side-by-side, one confirms the new low, the other doesn't.

## Timeframes

M5–D. Most-traded on H1 and H4.

## Examples

**Example 1 — EURUSD vs GBPUSD bullish SMT at session low:**
- Asia: EURUSD low 1.0848, GBPUSD low 1.2645.
- London open: EURUSD wicks 1.0843 (new low), closes 1.0855.
- Same M5: GBPUSD wicks 1.2648 (HIGHER than 1.2645).
- → bullish SMT. EURUSD took new low, GBPUSD did not.
- Long EURUSD or GBPUSD on next bullish FVG.

**Example 2 — BTC vs ETH bullish SMT (crypto, outside FX):**
- The same correlated-pair technique applies directly to crypto: BTC and ETH (the two largest assets by market cap) form a symmetrical-correlation pair, analogous to EURUSD/GBPUSD.
- BTC sweeps a session low; ETH's matching swing holds higher — bullish SMT, no modification to the FX method needed.

## Common Mistakes

- **Comparing weakly-correlated pairs.** EURUSD vs USDJPY has weaker / inconsistent correlation — SMT logic becomes unreliable, not inverted. Inverse SMT applies only to strong-negative pairings (e.g. EURUSD vs DXY).
- **Trusting JPY-cross groupings like USD-base groupings.** EUR/JPY vs GBP/JPY looks like the same pattern as EURUSD/GBPUSD, but JPY-quoted crosses correlate less consistently than USD-quoted pairs — verify the correlation strength before relying on it (a free tool like Myfxbook's correlation matrix, checked across 1-day/1-week/1-month windows, catches this before it costs a trade).
- **Wrong time alignment.** Compare 03:00 NY EURUSD with 03:00 NY GBPUSD, not adjacent candles.
- **Ignoring the structural level.** SMT at a random pair of M1 candles is noise; SMT at a known SSL/BSL is the signal.
