## Definition

**SMT (Smart Money Technique) Divergence** is a price-action divergence between **two correlated assets**: when one asset makes a new high (or low) but the correlated asset fails to confirm with its own new high (or low), the divergence signals that institutional flow is differentiated and a reversal often follows. Common SMT pairings: EURUSD vs GBPUSD, NQ vs ES (US indices), gold vs silver, EURUSD vs DXY (inverse). SMT is one of ICT's most-relied-upon confirmation signals — entering a setup with SMT confluence is significantly higher conviction than without.

## Formal Criteria

For a bullish SMT (signaling possible bullish reversal):

- Two correlated assets are trending bearishly.
- Asset A makes a new low (continuation).
- Asset B does NOT make a new low — it makes a higher low (divergence).
- The divergence is the SMT signal: institutional buying is differential.

For a bearish SMT: symmetric (Asset A new high, Asset B lower high).

## Formula / Math

```
correlated_pair = (asset_A, asset_B)         # e.g., EURUSD, GBPUSD

bullish_smt(t):
    asset_A.makes_new_low_at(t)
    AND asset_B.does_not_confirm_new_low(t)  # higher-low instead

bearish_smt(t):
    asset_A.makes_new_high_at(t)
    AND asset_B.does_not_confirm_new_high(t) # lower-high instead
```

## Visual Pattern

```
   bullish SMT (correlated pair, both bearish):

   Asset A (e.g. EURUSD):                 Asset B (e.g. GBPUSD):
        ▼                                       ▼
       ▼▼                                      ▼▼
      ▼▼▼  ← prior low                        ▼▼▼  ← prior low
      
            ▼                                       ▼
           ▼▼                                      ▼▼  ← higher low
          ▼▼▼  ← NEW LOW                          ▼▼  (failed to confirm)
   
   → bullish SMT divergence: A made new low, B did not.
```

## Timeframes

M5–D. HTF SMT (D, W) is most reliable; LTF SMT (M5) noisier but useful for entry timing.

## Examples

**Example 1 — bullish SMT on EURUSD/GBPUSD H1:**
- 09:00 NY: EURUSD prints H1 low at 1.0840 (new low for the day).
- Same hour: GBPUSD's matching low at 1.2650, but the GBPUSD H1 candle's low is 1.2655 (higher than its prior low 1.2645 from earlier).
- → bullish SMT. EURUSD made new low; GBPUSD did not.
- High-conviction long setup: enter on next bullish FVG / OB on EURUSD.

## Common Mistakes

- **Wrong pair correlation.** Use truly correlated pairs. EURUSD vs GBPUSD: positive correlation. EURUSD vs DXY: strong negative (inverse SMT logic applies). EURUSD vs USDJPY: weaker correlation, less reliable.
- **Single-bar SMT.** Compare the same swing event across the two assets, not random bars.
- **No confluence.** SMT alone is a confirmation signal, not a setup. Pair with PD-array + bias.
