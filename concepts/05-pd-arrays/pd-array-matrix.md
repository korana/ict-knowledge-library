## Definition

The PD array matrix is the **PDA-side counterpart of the [liquidity-matrix](../02-liquidity/liquidity-matrix.md)**: a structured pre-trade tabulation of every relevant PD array across multiple timeframes, sorted by price, listing TF / array type / depth (premium or discount with its depth value) / freshness / direction. It is a working document the analyst maintains during the session — adding new arrays as they form, marking arrays as "tested" or "mitigated" once price interacts with them.

## Formal Criteria

A complete matrix lists, for the current symbol:

- Above and below current price, every PD array on M15 / H1 / H4 / D / W.
- For each array: TF, type (OB / FVG / breaker / etc.), price range, premium-or-discount + depth, freshness (unmitigated / partially / fully mitigated), polarity (bullish / bearish).
- Sorted by price for navigation.
- Optional: HTF-LTF nesting indicators (which arrays nest inside others).

## Formula / Math

```
matrix(t) = sort_by_price([
  { tf: M15 | H1 | H4 | D | W,
    type: OB | FVG | breaker | mitigation | rejection | propulsion | vacuum | EQ,
    price_range: [low, high],
    side: premium | discount,
    depth: float in [0, 1],
    polarity: bullish | bearish,
    fresh: bool,
    nested_with: [list of other matrix entries it overlaps]
  }
  for every identified array
])
```

## Visual Pattern

A tabular view, not a chart pattern. Sample matrix for a bullish-bias EURUSD intraday session:

```
TF   Type      Range            Side    Depth  Polarity  Fresh  Nest
──   ───────   ──────────────   ──────  ─────  ────────  ─────  ────
W    OB        1.0950–1.0970    premium 0.71   bear      yes    -
D    FVG       1.0935–1.0945    premium 0.40   bear      yes    nested in W OB
D    EQ        1.0900           --      0.50   --        --     -
H4   OB        1.0840–1.0850    discount 0.50  bull      yes    -
H4   FVG       1.0825–1.0835    discount 0.71  bull      yes    -
H1   OB        1.0820–1.0830    discount 0.78  bull      yes    nested in H4 FVG
─── current price 1.0855 ───
H1   FVG       1.0808–1.0815    discount 0.92  bull      yes    -
D    OB        1.0790–1.0800    discount 0.95  bull      yes    -
```

## Timeframes

The matrix is multi-TF by definition. Don't include arrays from below your minimum entry TF (clutter).

## Examples

**Example 1 — using the matrix:**
- HTF (D, W) bullish bias.
- Matrix shows nested H4-FVG / H1-OB at 1.0820–1.0835 (deep discount, fresh).
- Pre-trade plan: long entry on retest of 1.0820–1.0830 with SL below H1 OB (1.0815), TP1 at D EQ (1.0900), TP2 at D FVG (1.0935), final at W OB premium (1.0970).

## Common Mistakes

- **Not to be confused with [pd-array-stack](pd-array-stack.md).** A 2026 community source uses "PD Array Matrix" as its own name for a fixed 7-layer spatial retest ordering — a static conceptual model, not this file's per-trade tabulation tool. If a source says "PD Array Matrix," check whether it means this working document or that ordering.
- **Listing everything.** Too many entries make the matrix unusable. Cap by TF (M15+) and by freshness (unmitigated only).
- **Static matrix.** Refresh as price interacts with arrays — once an array is mitigated or invalidated by a BOS, mark it as such.
- **Skipping nesting markers.** Nested arrays often produce the strongest setups; explicitly note which arrays overlap.

> Confidence is `medium` because the term "PD array matrix" is community-popularized; ICT's own usage emphasizes the discipline rather than the specific tabular format.
