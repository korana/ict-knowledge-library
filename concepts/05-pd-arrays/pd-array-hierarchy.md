## Definition

The PD array hierarchy is ICT's ranked ordering of PD-array types by conviction strength. Not all arrays are equal: a fresh, unmitigated bullish OB at deep discount is stronger than a small bullish FVG mid-range. ICT teaches a rough ranking to help analysts prioritize entries when multiple PD arrays are present in the dealing range.

## Formal Criteria

The canonical conviction ranking ICT teaches (from highest to lower, single-TF):

1. **Order Block (OB) at EXTREMES of the range** — fresh, unmitigated, formed on a clean swing pivot.
2. **Breaker Block** — flipped OB; high conviction on second test.
3. **Fair Value Gap (FVG)** at deep premium/discount — fresh, unfilled, with displacement signature.
4. **Mitigation Block** — relevant when the prior OB was already mitigated.
5. **Rejection Block** — visible long-wick rejection at a level.
6. **Equilibrium (EQ)** — used as a decision pivot when a clean OB or FVG isn't present.
7. **Generic level** (round number, prior small swing) — lowest conviction.

Modifiers that raise rank within type:

- Freshness: unmitigated > mitigated.
- Depth: deeper into premium / discount = higher rank.
- HTF confluence (a level that aligns with a higher-TF array).
- Time-of-day alignment (formed inside or aligned with a killzone).

## Formula / Math

The hierarchy is qualitative, but a working ranking score:

```
score(PDA) =
    base_rank(type)            # OB=7, BB=6, FVG=5, MB=4, RB=3, EQ=2, generic=1
  + freshness_bonus             # +2 if unmitigated, 0 otherwise
  + depth_bonus                 # +1 per 0.1 of depth_into_range_side
  + htf_confluence_bonus        # +3 if aligned with HTF array
  + killzone_alignment_bonus    # +1 if formed inside a KZ
```

(This is not from ICT directly; it's a quantification of the ranking he teaches qualitatively.)

## Visual Pattern

```
   range top ──────────────  premium

           ▒▒  bearish OB (fresh, deep)   ← rank 7+
           ▓▓  breaker                    ← rank 6
           ░░  bearish FVG                ← rank 5

   ────── EQ ──────────────────────────────

           ░░  bullish FVG                ← rank 5
           ▓▓  breaker                    ← rank 6
           ▒▒  bullish OB (fresh, deep)   ← rank 7+

   range bot ──────────────  discount
```

## Timeframes

The hierarchy applies at any TF; what shifts is the **HTF confluence bonus** — an LTF FVG that aligns with an HTF OB ranks higher than an LTF FVG with no HTF support.

## Examples

**Example 1 — picking among multiple discount arrays:**
- HTF bullish; H4 dealing range 1.0800–1.1000, EQ 1.0900.
- Three candidate longs in discount: bullish OB at 1.0820 (fresh), bullish FVG at 1.0860 (fresh), generic equal-low at 1.0850 (no displacement signature).
- Hierarchy: OB > FVG > generic.
- Pick: OB at 1.0820 (rank 7+ depth ~0.8). FVG at 1.0860 is the secondary fallback if 1.0820 is missed.

## Common Mistakes

- **Not to be confused with [pd-array-stack](pd-array-stack.md).** That file describes the *spatial order* price tests arrays in as it retraces from an MSS toward equilibrium — a different axis from this file's *entry-conviction ranking*. The two orderings needn't agree, and a community source's "PD Array Matrix" naming for its stack model can be mistaken for this hierarchy or for [pd-array-matrix](pd-array-matrix.md) if not read carefully.
- **Treating ranks as fixed.** A poorly-formed OB (no displacement, no swing-pivot anchor) can be worse than a clean FVG. Rank type, then sanity-check formation quality.
- **Ignoring depth.** A premium OB at depth 0.3 is much weaker than a premium FVG at depth 0.79.
- **Skipping HTF confluence.** An LTF-only array without HTF support is a low-conviction entry regardless of its single-TF rank.
- **Picking the shallowest of several stacked FVGs.** When multiple FVGs stack inside the same premium/discount zone, the depth bonus above still applies between them — a community source (`THAI-COMMUNITY-2026-LIQUIDITY-VOID`, pp.128–129) calls the deepest OB reference in such a stack the "Extreme Order Block" and recommends it over the shallowest FVG. That's this file's existing `depth_bonus` modifier under a different name, not a new array type.
