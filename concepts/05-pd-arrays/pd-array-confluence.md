## Definition

PD array confluence is the **alignment of multiple independent factors** at a single price level — distinct from but related to nesting. Where [pd-array-nesting](pd-array-nesting.md) requires same-direction PD arrays overlapping spatially, confluence is broader: it includes time-of-day (killzone, macro), HTF bias, structural context (CHoCH/MSS just delivered), and adjacent liquidity pools (sweep target nearby) — all firing at the same level. ICT's discipline: **the more independent factors that align, the higher the conviction.**

## Formal Criteria

Independent confluence factors that ICT teaches:

1. **Spatial PD-array nesting** — bullish OB containing bullish FVG (counts as 1 nest, often 2 arrays).
2. **HTF alignment** — entry-TF array sits inside an HTF array.
3. **Bias agreement** — HTF bias direction matches setup direction.
4. **Time-of-day** — setup forms inside a killzone or macro window.
5. **Structural context** — recent MSS / CHoCH supports the direction.
6. **Adjacent liquidity** — clear DOL above (longs) / below (shorts) within reach.
7. **Fresh, unmitigated arrays** — preferred over already-tested ones.

A medium-confluence setup has 3–4 factors firing; high-confluence has 5+; low-confluence has 1–2.

**Selection filter within factor 7 (community-attributed):** when several same-side, unmitigated arrays exist inside one dealing range, a 2026 community source narrows "freshness" into an explicit selection procedure: discard any array that formed on the far side of the range's Equilibrium (i.e. before price crossed EQ into the current discount/premium half — those belong to the opposite side's structure) even if price technically respected them, then prefer whichever remaining array sits in confluence with the EQ 50% level itself. The source applies this both to a plain FVG selection and to choosing which of several [inversion-fvg](../06-fair-value-gaps/inversion-fvg.md) candidates to trade — "not every position, even if price respects the FVG."

## Formula / Math

```
confluence_score(setup) = sum(1 for factor in factors if active(factor, setup))

# Working scale:
# 1-2 factors:  low confluence (skip or tiny size)
# 3-4 factors:  medium confluence (standard size)
# 5-6 factors:  high confluence (full size, increased conviction)
# 7+:           rare; reserved for "A+" setups
```

## Visual Pattern

```
Confluence at a single setup zone (bullish discount example):

   ░░░░░ ←  H4 bullish OB (factor 1: HTF array)
   ░▓▓░░    │
   ░▓░▓░ ←  H1 bullish FVG nested inside (factor 2: nesting)
   ░░░░░    │
            ↑
     deep discount of D range (factor 3: depth)
     HTF bias bullish        (factor 4: bias)
     formed in NY AM KZ      (factor 5: time-of-day)
     macro 09:50-10:10       (factor 6: precision time)
     fresh, unmitigated      (factor 7: freshness)
     PWL SSL just swept      (factor 8: adjacent liquidity from below)
     PDH BSL above as DOL    (factor 9: clear target)

   → 9-factor confluence = "A+" setup
```

## Timeframes

Most actionable on entry TFs (M5 / M15) where multiple factors can align. HTF-only setups still count factors but typically with broader, more diffuse alignment.

## Examples

**Example 1 — counting factors:**
- HTF bias bullish.
- Setup: bullish OB at H4, M15 FVG nested inside it.
- Time: NY AM KZ + 09:50 macro starting.
- Recent: M5 just printed bullish CHoCH 10 min ago.
- DOL: PDH BSL 60 pips above.
- Freshness: both arrays unmitigated.
- → factors: nesting, HTF align, bias, time-of-day (KZ), time-of-day (macro), structure (CHoCH), adjacent liquidity (DOL), freshness = 8 factors → "A+" setup.

## Common Mistakes

- **Counting dependent factors as independent.** "Bullish OB" and "discount-side array" are not independent — the OB being on the bull side already implies it's at discount if we're long-biased. Count once.
- **Confluence theatre.** Adding spurious "factors" (e.g., RSI, MA crossings) inflates the score without adding ICT-relevant signal. Stick to ICT factors.
- **Single-factor trades.** Acting on a single factor (e.g., "fresh OB" with nothing else) leads to many low-quality entries; require 3+ for standard setups.
