## Definition

A bullish breaker is a **failed bearish order block** — an originally bearish OB whose top edge price violated by closing above with displacement. The OB body now functions as a **bullish support zone** on retest from above. The flipped polarity reflects an institutional intent change: the bearish OB was rejected, and the algorithm now defends the same zone for longs.

## Formal Criteria

- An originally bearish OB existed (last bullish candle before bearish displacement).
- Price subsequently broke ABOVE the OB body (close above the OB high) with bullish displacement.
- Often a bullish CHoCH or BOS accompanies the break.
- On retest from above (price comes back down to OB body), the zone acts as bullish support.

## Formula / Math

```
break_event(bearish_ob) := close_t > high(ob_body)
                            AND bullish_displacement_present_in_break

bullish_breaker_active(ob, retest) := low(retest) reaches high(ob_body)
                                       AND bullish_rejection_with_displacement
```

## Visual Pattern

```
   bullish breaker formation:

   Step 1: bearish OB forms (last bullish candle before bearish move)
   Step 2: later, price breaks UPWARD through OB high with displacement
           → bullish CHoCH/BOS
   Step 3: retest comes back down to OB body
   Step 4: bullish rejection at OB body → confirmed bullish breaker
                                       (long entry zone)
```

## Timeframes

M15+.

## Examples

**Example 1 — H1 bearish OB → bullish breaker:**
- H1 bearish OB formed: body 1.0945–1.0955.
- Two days later, H1 closes at 1.0962 with bullish displacement; bullish CHoCH on H1.
- Hours later, H1 retraces down to 1.0950 (inside original OB body).
- Bullish reaction with FVG up → confirmed bullish breaker.
- Long at MT 1.0950, SL below OB low at 1.0942 (3-pip buffer). Risk = 8 pips.

**Example 2 (2026) — worked sequence per `THAI-COMMUNITY-2026-BREAKER-BLOCK` pp. 57–60:** HTF bearish; price fails to print a new Lower Low (Failure Swing per Dow Theory), sweeps sell-side liquidity below a recent Equal Low/SSL pool, then breaks above the most recent Lower High — a bullish MSS. The failed bearish OB below that swept low flips to a bullish breaker.

## Common Mistakes

- **Wick-through.** A wick that pokes above OB high but closes back inside doesn't trigger the breaker.
- **No displacement.** A drift through the OB without displacement makes the break low-conviction.
- **Reversed polarity.** A bullish OB doesn't become a bullish breaker — it becomes a bearish one (see [bearish-breaker](bearish-breaker.md)).
- **Trading a bullish breaker sitting above equilibrium (2026 community source, not an ICT-published gate).** `THAI-COMMUNITY-2026-BREAKER-BLOCK` treats a bullish breaker that isn't in the discount zone as a much weaker candidate (tighter SL required) — see [breaker-block](breaker-block.md)'s Common Mistakes for the full note; this is a conviction modifier, not a formal requirement here.
