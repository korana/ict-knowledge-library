# Breaker vs Mitigation Block — Disambiguation

## Definition

Breaker blocks and mitigation blocks are often confused in ICT discussion. Both involve a violated OB area being retested later — but they differ in **what kind of structural break preceded the retest**.

**Short version:**
- **Breaker** = OB violated as part of a **CHoCH/MSS** (polarity flip; the bias has changed).
- **Mitigation block** = OB violated as part of a **BOS** (no polarity flip; trend continues).

Same retest geometry, different structural meaning. The distinction matters because breakers are reversal-context references while mitigation blocks are continuation references.

> **Note (2026):** this page assumes the ICT-2018-BLOCKS reading of "Mitigation Block" (continuation, no polarity flip). A separate community source uses the same term for a reversal-anchored object instead — see [mitigation-block](mitigation-block.md)'s `## ICT vs Community` section, which now carries a `disputed` confidence rating, before applying this disambiguation.

> **Note (2026), reaction speed:** that same community source (`THAI-COMMUNITY-2026-BREAKER-BLOCK`, p.63), speaking of its own reversal-anchored Mitigation Block reading and its ICT-based Breaker Block, states the Breaker Block reacts **slower** than its Mitigation Block "because Mitigation Block gets a bonus effect from the Failure Swing itself" — i.e. in that source's own model the Mitigation Block's reaction is boosted by the Failure Swing pattern that precedes it, while its Breaker Block has no equivalent boost. This is the author's own observation about his two reversal-anchored constructs, not a claim about the ICT-2018-BLOCKS continuation reading of Mitigation Block on this page.

## Formal Criteria

### Breaker

- OB violated by close-through with displacement.
- The break was a **CHoCH or MSS**.
- Polarity FLIPS (bullish OB → bearish breaker, or vice versa).
- Retest reaction is in the new direction.

### Mitigation Block

- OB violated by close-through (or sometimes by a wick).
- The break was a **BOS** in the existing trend.
- Polarity DOES NOT flip (bullish OB stays a bullish reference for continuation).
- Retest reaction is in the same direction as the original OB.

### The Containment Relationship

```
Both: violated OB returning later as a structural reference.
Breaker:    new direction (polarity flip)
Mitigation: same direction (no flip)
```

## Formula / Math

```
classify(ob_violated):
    if break_was_CHoCH_or_MSS:
        return "breaker"   (polarity flips)
    elif break_was_BOS_in_existing_trend:
        return "mitigation_block"   (polarity persists)
```

## Visual Pattern

```
   Breaker (polarity flip):                  Mitigation block (same polarity):

   bullish OB ─▼▼                            bullish OB ─▼▼
              ▲▲                                          ▲▲▲ (BOS up - trend up)
              ▲▲ ▼ ← break DOWN                                 (no CHoCH)
                ▼▼ (CHoCH down)                          
                ▼▼                                          retest ↓ → bullish reaction
                                                                 (still long bias)
   retest ↑ → bearish reaction
   (now short bias)
```

## Timeframes

M15+.

## Examples

**Example A — breaker:**
- Bullish OB existed.
- Price closes below OB low; this break IS a bearish CHoCH (prior trend was bullish).
- → bullish OB → bearish breaker. Polarity flipped. Retest → short.

**Example B — mitigation block:**
- Bullish OB existed during an uptrend.
- Price wicks below OB low briefly (or closes barely below) but then immediately prints a higher-high BOS (uptrend continues).
- No CHoCH; trend stays bullish.
- → mitigation block. Polarity persists. Retest → long (continuation).

## Common Mistakes

- **Treating all violated OBs as breakers.** Many violated OBs in trending markets are mitigation blocks, not breakers — no polarity flip occurs.
- **Mislabeling the structural break.** The CHoCH-vs-BOS classification is the key — get that right and the breaker-vs-mitigation classification follows.
- **Trading retest without checking which type.** Breaker = trade the new direction; mitigation = trade the original direction. Mixing them up trades against the algorithm.
