## Definition

The **True Day Open (TDO)** is the **00:00 NY-time price** — the official daily candle opening per ICT's framework. Distinct from "session open" or "broker open" times: TDO is anchored to NY midnight regardless of broker convention. ICT teaches TDO as the **primary intraday premium/discount reference**: price above TDO = intraday premium (favor shorts in bearish-bias contexts); price below TDO = intraday discount (favor longs in bullish-bias contexts). TDO is one of the most-cited time-of-day pivots in ICT analysis.

## Formal Criteria

- TDO = open price at exactly 00:00 NY (midnight, NY clock).
- Not the same as: 17:00 NY forex close, 18:00 NY Sunday open (NWOG), or broker server-time daily candle open.
- Acts as a horizontal price level on intraday charts; price relative to TDO drives intraday bias.
- Premium / discount classification on intraday is **TDO-anchored**, not necessarily the same as the daily-dealing-range premium/discount.

## Formula / Math

```
tdo = open_price_at(00:00 NY)

intraday_premium_vs_TDO := current_price > tdo
intraday_discount_vs_TDO := current_price < tdo

# Combined with HTF bias:
bullish_bias_setup_zone := price < tdo (intraday discount in bullish bias)
bearish_bias_setup_zone := price > tdo (intraday premium in bearish bias)
```

## Visual Pattern

```
   TDO as intraday pivot:

   intraday premium (above TDO)
   ───────── TDO (00:00 NY) ─────────
   intraday discount (below TDO)

   bullish bias + price below TDO = preferred long-zone
   bearish bias + price above TDO = preferred short-zone
```

## Timeframes

M5 / M15 / H1 / H4.

## Examples

**Example 1 — TDO + HTF bias confluence:**
- HTF bias bullish.
- TDO = 1.0860 (00:00 NY open).
- Current price 1.0840 → intraday discount vs TDO.
- → preferred long-zone; setups in this zone get TDO-confluence bonus.

## Common Mistakes

- **Using broker time as TDO.** If broker's daily candle opens at 17:00 NY (forex) or some other server-time, that is NOT the TDO; recompute the 00:00 NY open.
- **Confusing TDO with 17:00 NY close.** TDO is the open, not the close.
- **Ignoring TDO for intraday bias.** Many intraday traders skip TDO and use only daily range EQ; combining both is stronger.
- **Missing TDO's role in the Judas Swing window.** A 2026 community source frames TDO's 00:00 NY reset as the anchor point of a three-session overlap (NY midnight reset, London open, Tokyo/Asian close) that explains why the [london-judas-swing](../13-judas-swing/london-judas-swing.md) window forms where it does.
