## Definition

Equal lows are two or more swing lows at approximately the same price level — the densest form of [sell-side-liquidity](sell-side-liquidity.md). Mirror of [equal-highs](equal-highs.md). EQL is a primary algorithmic sweep target because retail double-bottom stops cluster just below the second touch.

## Formal Criteria

- Two or more swing lows print within a small price tolerance of each other.
- Tolerance is TF- and instrument-specific (a few pips on majors).
- A swing high must exist between them (otherwise they're consecutive bars in a single downleg, not distinct pivots).
- Strict EQL: tolerance = 0. Relative EQL (REL): small ε > 0.

## Formula / Math

```
tolerance = ε

equal_lows(SL_1, SL_2) := |L(SL_1) - L(SL_2)| <= ε
                          AND exists(SH between SL_1 and SL_2)
```

## Timeframes

Every TF.

## Examples

**Example 1 — Asian-range EQL:**
- During Asia, M5 prints two lows at 1.0830 and 1.0831 separated by a brief rally.
- Tolerance 2 pips → equal lows. Asian SSL pool established.
- London open often sweeps these before reversing; if HTF bias is bullish, the sweep is the long entry trigger.

## Common Mistakes

- **Tolerance too tight or too loose.** 0-pip strict matching misses obvious patterns; 10+ pips on EURUSD H1 is too loose. Calibrate per instrument.
- **No intervening pivot.** Two adjacent bars at the same low are not EQL.
- **Reversal certainty.** EQL sweep often reverses but not always; require PD-array / session confluence.
- **Looking here for the sweep+FVG+MSS entry technique.** This file covers what EQL *is*, not how to trade a sweep of it. For a worked EQL sweep + FVG + Market Structure Shift + equilibrium-rebalance entry example, see [turtle-soup](../20-turtle-soup/turtle-soup.md)'s Examples.
