# Unicorn Model

**Category:** 31-models
**Aliases:** ICT Unicorn, the Unicorn, unicorn setup
**ICT Confidence:** high
**Year Introduced:** 2023
**Year Refined:** 2026

**Tags:** model, unicorn, 2023

## Definition

The **Unicorn Model** is a high-conviction multi-confluence ICT setup — named for its rarity. The Unicorn requires the simultaneous presence of: a breaker block, an FVG inside the breaker, alignment with HTF bias, AND a clean liquidity sweep before the breaker formed. When all four conditions stack at the same level, the setup is the closest ICT publishes to "an A++ trade." Unicorns are infrequent but among the highest-probability ICT entries.

## Formal Criteria

A Unicorn requires ALL of:

1. **Breaker block** has formed (failed OB whose polarity has flipped).
2. **FVG nested inside the breaker zone** (same direction as the breaker's new polarity).
3. **HTF bias agrees** with the breaker direction (bullish breaker requires bullish HTF; mirror).
4. **Liquidity sweep** preceded the breaker formation (typically the sweep that triggered the original CHoCH/MSS).

When all four align at the same price zone, the setup is "Unicorn-grade."

**Killzone-only, stated explicitly (community-attributed).** A 2026 community source adds a fifth constraint this file previously carried no time criterion for: the Unicorn only occurs during the **London or NY killzone** — *"Setup Unicorn นี้จะไม่เกิดพร่ำเพื่อ จะเกิดจะเฉพาะช่วงเวลาเท่านั้น"* ("this Unicorn Setup won't occur carelessly — it occurs only during that specific time window"), consistent with the setup's deliberate rarity. The same source also independently corroborates this file's criterion 2 (breaker∩FVG overlap) as the feature that most distinguishes Unicorn from its own plainer [ict-2022-model](ict-2022-model.md) variants — its own words: *"จุดเข้าออเดอร์จะต้องมีการทับซ้อนกันระหว่าง Breaker Block กับ Fair Value Gap"* ("the entry point must have overlap between the Breaker Block and the Fair Value Gap").

## Formula / Math

```
unicorn(zone):
    breaker_block_present(zone)
    AND fvg_nested_inside_breaker(zone)
    AND htf_bias_matches_breaker_direction
    AND prior_liquidity_sweep_triggered_breaker
```

## Visual Pattern

```
   bullish Unicorn:

   prior bearish leg ↓
        sweep at SSL (manipulation)  → triggers CHoCH up
        bearish OB at swing low → flipped to bullish breaker
        FVG forms inside the breaker zone (same bullish direction)
        HTF (D, W) bullish

   → all 4 conditions align at the breaker-FVG zone.
   → high-conviction long entry on FVG CE retest with SL beyond breaker invalidation.
```

## Timeframes

M15+. HTF Unicorns (H4, D) are the most-cited variant.

## Examples

**Example 1 — H1 bullish Unicorn:**
- Prior: H1 bearish leg, swept SSL at 1.0820 (trigger).
- H1 CHoCH up; the H1 swing-high bearish OB at 1.0840-1.0850 flipped to bullish breaker.
- Inside the breaker body, an H1 bullish FVG at 1.0843-1.0847.
- HTF (D, W) bullish ✓.
- All 4 Unicorn conditions met at 1.0843–1.0850.
- Long entry at FVG CE 1.0845; SL below breaker invalidation 1.0838; risk 7 pips.
- Target HTF DOL: 1.0925 (PDH BSL). 80 pips reward → ~11R.

## Common Mistakes

- **Calling 3-of-4 setups "Unicorn."** The hallmark is **all 4** conditions. 3-of-4 is a strong setup but not a Unicorn.
- **Forcing Unicorn classification.** Unicorns are deliberately rare — most setups are 2022/2023 models, not Unicorns.
- **Ignoring HTF bias.** A "Unicorn" against HTF bias is just a confluence cluster that will likely fail.
