# Weekly Bias

## Definition

Weekly bias is the directional read from the **weekly chart**. ICT teaches weekly bias as the **primary HTF anchor for swing traders** and a major confluence input for day-traders. Weekly structure changes more slowly than daily but more quickly than monthly; it's the practical "where is the algorithm headed this week" read.

## Formal Criteria

Weekly bias is bullish when:

- Most recent weekly external BOS was up.
- Price below weekly EQ.
- Weekly DOL is upside (PWH-area BSL ahead).

Bearish when symmetric. Neutral when conflicting / at EQ.

Common time-of-week tendency: PWL (previous week low) often gets swept early in the week (Mon/Tue) before the weekly direction asserts (Wed-Thu distribution). A 2026 community source names this specific shape "Classic Tuesday Low/High of Week" — see [weekly-profile-patterns](../22-quarterly-theory/weekly-profile-patterns.md) for that named taxonomy and five sibling shapes.

## Formula / Math

```
weekly_dealing_range = [LTL_w, LTH_w]
w_eq = (LTL_w + LTH_w) / 2

weekly_bias :=
  "bullish" if last_w_external == bullish AND price < w_eq AND upside_DOL
  "bearish" if last_w_external == bearish AND price > w_eq AND downside_DOL
  "neutral" otherwise
```

## Visual Pattern

```
   Weekly chart bullish bias example:

   PWH ─────────── (last week's high; targeting)
       /\
      /  \  ← this week's price drift below PWH
   ──────── W_EQ
            (price retraced to discount)
   PWL ──────── (last week's low; recently swept = manipulation phase done)
```

## Timeframes

W / D.

## Examples

**Example 1 — Tue weekly-bias confirmation:**
- W LTH 1.1000, W LTL 1.0750. W_EQ = 1.0875.
- Mon: tight range above 1.0820 (Q1 / accumulation).
- Tue: M15 wicks 1.0815 (PWL SSL swept = manipulation), reverses up.
- → weekly bias bullish; Wed onwards expect distribution toward W LTH.

## Common Mistakes

- **Late-week bias change.** A weekly CHoCH near Friday may reverse on Sunday/Monday open; wait for a fresh week's confirmation.
- **Day-trading weekly bias only.** Weekly is backdrop; daily-and-below structures the actual entries.
