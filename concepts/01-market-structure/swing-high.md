## Definition

A swing high is a local price peak — a candle (or bar) whose high is greater than the highs of the candles to its immediate left and right. ICT uses swing highs as the building blocks of market structure: every break-of-structure (BOS), change-of-character (CHoCH), and liquidity raid is referenced against a swing high or swing low.

## Formal Criteria

The simplest (3-bar) ICT definition:

- A candle at index `n` qualifies as a swing high if and only if `H_n > H_{n-1}` AND `H_n > H_{n+1}`.
- Wicks count — the comparison uses the candle high, not the close or body.
- The swing high is confirmed only after candle `n+1` closes; it is unconfirmed in real time on the active candle.

ICT also teaches a fractal hierarchy by aggregating swing points:

- **Short-Term High (STH):** any 3-bar swing high.
- **Intermediate-Term High (ITH):** an STH whose adjacent STHs are both lower than it.
- **Long-Term High (LTH):** an ITH whose adjacent ITHs are both lower than it.

This produces a recursive structure: LTH ⊃ ITH ⊃ STH.

**Candle-cluster confirmation (community-attributed alternative).** A 2026 community source, for the specific purpose of validating a swing high as a genuine Daily Bias anchor (not for structure/BOS purposes generally), requires the swing to be marked by a **3-candle reversal cluster** — an Evening Star, or a Three Inside Down — rather than accepting any bare 3-bar `H_n > H_{n-1} AND H_n > H_{n+1}` peak. This is the identical cluster list a different chapter by the same author already uses to locate a CISD candle (see [cisd](../07-order-blocks/cisd.md) Common Mistakes) — same author's own technique reused for a second purpose, not independent corroboration. Treat as an added confidence filter for high-stakes anchors (e.g. [daily-bias](../25-htf-bias/daily-bias.md)'s Method 3), not a replacement for the ICT 3-bar definition above.

## Formula / Math

```
swing_high(n) := H_n > H_{n-1} AND H_n > H_{n+1}

short_term_high(n)        := swing_high(n)
intermediate_term_high(n) := short_term_high(n)
                              AND H_n > H_{prev_STH}
                              AND H_n > H_{next_STH}
long_term_high(n)         := intermediate_term_high(n)
                              AND H_n > H_{prev_ITH}
                              AND H_n > H_{next_ITH}
```

Where `H_n` is the high (including upper wick) of candle at index `n`.

## Visual Pattern

```

   /|\
  / | \

n-1     n+1
```

Three-candle pattern. The middle candle (`n`) has a high strictly greater than both neighbors. The body color does not matter; only the high price.

## Timeframes

Applies to every timeframe ICT teaches: M1 through MN1. Higher-timeframe swing highs carry more structural weight (a daily swing high is more significant than an M5 swing high). On lower timeframes, noise creates many short-term highs that get aggregated into intermediate-term and long-term highs as you zoom out.

## Examples

**Example 1 — generic 3-bar pattern:**
- Candle n-1 high = 1.0850
- Candle n high = 1.0875
- Candle n+1 high = 1.0860
- → n is a swing high (a short-term high).

**Example 2 — STH that is NOT an ITH:**
- Three consecutive STHs at 1.0875, 1.0890, 1.0880.
- The middle STH (1.0890) IS an ITH because both adjacent STHs are lower.
- The first STH (1.0875) is NOT an ITH because the next STH is higher.

## Common Mistakes

- **Using close instead of high.** ICT swing definitions use the candle high (wick top), not the close. A long upper wick that exceeds neighboring highs creates a valid swing high.
- **Calling an unconfirmed candle a swing high.** A swing high is only confirmed after the next candle closes. On the live candle you have at most a candidate.
- **Confusing STH/ITH/LTH levels.** Most retail platforms only mark STHs; the fractal hierarchy is what gives swing highs their structural meaning in ICT.
- **Equal highs.** Two adjacent equal highs do NOT form a single swing high; they form an EQH liquidity pool. See [equal-highs](../02-liquidity/equal-highs.md).
