## Definition

Range contraction is the phase in which price oscillates inside a tightening dealing range with overlapping candles, narrow ATR, and no decisive directional close. ICT treats contraction as the **accumulation / engineered-liquidity phase** where institutional positioning happens before the next [range-expansion](range-expansion.md). It is the time-domain side of the AMD cycle's accumulation phase.

## Formal Criteria

- Price is bounded between a recent LTH and LTL with neither bound being broken on a candle close.
- ATR (or candle-body average) is materially lower than the recent expansion-phase average.
- A high proportion of candles overlap with their predecessors (no gap, no displacement).
- Equal highs and equal lows tend to form along the range boundaries — these are the engineered liquidity pools that the next expansion will sweep.

## Formula / Math

```
contraction := no_external_bos
                AND ATR_recent <= 0.7 * ATR_prior_expansion
                AND overlap_pct >= 0.7
```

`overlap_pct` = fraction of candles whose body overlaps the prior candle's range.

   █  █                       (tight, overlap-               █ █
                                heavy candles)               █  █
```

Visually distinct from expansion: many small bodies, lots of wicks, no decisive direction.

## Timeframes

All M5 → D. HTF contractions (D / H4) often last days and produce the largest subsequent expansion moves. LTF contractions are the staging area for session-based setups (Asian range, NY AM open range, etc.).

## Examples

**Example 1 — Asian session contraction:**
- During Asian hours, EURUSD oscillates in a 25-pip range on M5 with ATR ≈ 4 pips.
- → range contraction. Equal highs and equal lows form at the range bounds.
- London open often sweeps one bound and then expands toward the other (Judas swing → expansion).

## Common Mistakes

- **Calling every chop "consolidation".** Contraction has a specific structural definition: bounded by an LTH and LTL with no external BOS. Random chop without clear bounds is not the same.
- **Trading mean-reversion blindly inside contraction.** Tradeable mean-reversion setups inside a contraction need confluence with PD arrays, sessions, or HTF bias — not just "the range is tight."
- **Missing the engineered-liquidity bait.** Equal highs / equal lows that form during contraction are bait for the next sweep; assume they will be taken.
