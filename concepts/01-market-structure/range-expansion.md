## Definition

Range expansion is the phase in which price breaks out of a prior contraction or consolidation and travels with momentum, typically widening the average true range and producing displacement candles. ICT pairs expansion with [range-contraction](range-contraction.md) as the two complementary phases of price delivery: contraction builds energy via consolidation; expansion releases it via directional movement.

## Formal Criteria

- The most recent dealing range (consolidation between an LTH and an LTL) has just been broken via an external BOS.
- Subsequent candles show an ATR (or candle-body length) materially larger than the contraction-phase average.
- Price travels in a single direction with shallow pullbacks until it reaches its next external structure target (HTF liquidity pool, HTF PD array, etc.).
- Expansion ends when displacement subsides and price begins to consolidate again.

## Formula / Math

```
ATR_contraction = mean(true_range, last_N_contraction_bars)
ATR_expansion   = mean(true_range, last_N_post_break_bars)

range_expanding := ATR_expansion >= K * ATR_contraction      [K typically 1.5..3]
                    AND directional_close_count >= 0.7 * N    [70% closes in same direction]
```

ICT teaches expansion qualitatively rather than with a fixed numerical filter; the formula above is a common quantification used in research.

## Visual Pattern

```
   contraction               expansion
   ───────────────────       ───────────────
       /\  /\  /\                 ▲
      /  \/  \/  \               █▲
     /            \             █ █
    /              \           █  █
                              █   █
                     ─→ break ─→ wide directional candles
```

Tight, overlapping candles → external BOS → wide, mostly-one-color candles.

## Timeframes

Every TF M5 → W. Higher-TF expansion is rarer but produces the largest moves and the cleanest [displacement](../09-displacement/displacement-definition.md) signatures.

## Examples

**Example 1 — H1 expansion after contraction:**
- H1 prints 30 bars in a 35-pip range; ATR ≈ 8 pips.
- An H1 candle breaks the range high and prints a 28-pip body. Subsequent 5 bars all close green, average body 18 pips.
- → range expansion. Bias: continuation toward next HTF liquidity target.

## Common Mistakes

- **Confusing every breakout with expansion.** A break that immediately stalls is not expansion; it's a failed break or a sweep.
- **Ignoring direction quality.** Expansion is mostly one-color candles. Mixed-color, overlapping bodies = still ranging.
- **Trading against expansion.** ICT teaches that fading expansion is low-probability; counter-trend setups belong to the contraction phase or to specific HTF reversal setups (CHoCH/MSS).
