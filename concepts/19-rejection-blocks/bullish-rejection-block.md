## Definition

A bullish rejection block is a candle with a **long lower wick** that rejects downward at a key level, leaving the body near the top of the range. The wick documents an SSL sweep + immediate reversal. Functions as a discount-side reference for future long entries.

## Formal Criteria

- Long lower wick (≥ 60% of range).
- Wick tip reaches known SSL level (swing low, EQL, PWL/PDL, session low).
- Close near top of range.
- Next candle confirms with bullish displacement (ideally with FVG).

## Formula / Math

```
range_n     = high(n) - low(n)
lower_wick  = min(open(n), close(n)) - low(n)
upper_body  = max(open(n), close(n))

bullish_rb := lower_wick / range_n >= 0.60
              AND low(n) reaches known SSL level
              AND close(n) near upper_body
              AND next-candle displacement up
```

## Visual Pattern

```
            ▲ ← close near top
            █
            █
            █
          ▼   ← long lower wick (60%+)
          ▼
          ▼
         (low reaches SSL pool)
   ▲▲▲▲   ← next candle: bullish displacement up
```

## Timeframes

M15+.

## Examples

**Example 1 — bullish RB at Asian SSL:**
- M15 at 03:00 NY (London open).
- Candle: open 1.0855, close 1.0871, low 1.0846, high 1.0872.
- Lower wick = 9 pips; range = 26 pips; wick% = 35% (not yet a strict RB).
- Compare to a stricter RB candle: open 1.0855, close 1.0871, low 1.0846, high 1.0872 with wick 60%+ requirement → would need low at 1.0840 or so. Adjust the threshold per instrument.
- When all criteria met: bullish RB at 1.0846 (Asian SSL). Long bias for the rest of London open.

## Common Mistakes

- **Body-vs-wick confusion.** RB references the wick rejection zone; OB references the body. Don't mix them.
- **No SSL anchor.** A long lower wick without a key-level anchor is just a hammer candle — interesting but not RB-grade.
- **Multi-candle clusters / D1+ preference.** See [rejection-block](rejection-block.md)'s Common Mistakes for this source's zone-drawing convention (use the longest wick in a cluster) and its D1+/no-H4-or-below preference.
