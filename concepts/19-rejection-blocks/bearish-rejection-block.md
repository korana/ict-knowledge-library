## Definition

A bearish rejection block is a candle with a **long upper wick** rejecting upward at a key level, leaving the body near the bottom of the range. Documents a BSL sweep + immediate reversal. Premium-side reference for future short entries. Mirror of [bullish-rejection-block](bullish-rejection-block.md).

## Formal Criteria

- Long upper wick (≥ 60% of range).
- Wick tip reaches known BSL level (swing high, EQH, PWH/PDH, session high).
- Close near bottom of range.
- Next candle confirms with bearish displacement.

## Formula / Math

```
range_n     = high(n) - low(n)
upper_wick  = high(n) - max(open(n), close(n))

bearish_rb := upper_wick / range_n >= 0.60
              AND high(n) reaches known BSL level
              AND close(n) near bottom of range
              AND next-candle displacement down
```

## Visual Pattern

```
         (high reaches BSL pool)
          ▲
          ▲
          ▲   ← long upper wick (60%+)
          ▼
          █
          █
          █
            ← close near bottom

   ▼▼▼▼   ← next candle: bearish displacement down
```

## Timeframes

M15+.

## Examples

**Example 1 — bearish RB at PDH:**
- H1 candle at 14:00 NY: open 1.0915, close 1.0902, low 1.0900, high 1.0928.
- Upper wick = 13 pips; range = 28 pips; wick% = 46% — borderline. With stricter parameters (e.g., wick 1.0935): wick = 20 pips, wick% = 56%, plus next-candle displacement down → bearish RB.
- Wick reaches PDH at 1.0928. Bearish reaction confirms.
- Short bias for the next move.

## Common Mistakes

- **Confusing RB with OB.** Bearish OB uses the body of a bullish candle before bearish displacement. Bearish RB uses the upper wick of a single rejection candle.
- **Single-candle reliance.** Confirm with next-candle displacement; an isolated long-wick is weak.
- **Multi-candle clusters / D1+ preference.** See [rejection-block](rejection-block.md)'s Common Mistakes for this source's zone-drawing convention (use the longest wick in a cluster) and its D1+/no-H4-or-below preference.
