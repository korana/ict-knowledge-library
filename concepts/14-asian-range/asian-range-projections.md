## Definition

Asian range projections are extension targets that use the Asian range size as the unit of measurement and project price levels above and below the range — typically at multiples of 0.5×, 1×, 1.5×, 2× the Asian range size. ICT teaches that London / NY delivery often reaches an integer multiple of the Asian range from the side opposite to the initial sweep. Useful for estimating distance-of-day targets and partial-take levels.

## Formal Criteria

- Asian range size = `asian_high - asian_low`.
- Projections from the **non-swept** side (the side opposite the Judas swing):
  - 0.5× projection = swept_bound ± 0.5 × range
  - 1× projection = swept_bound ± 1 × range
  - 1.5× projection
  - 2× projection
- After a low-side sweep, project upward from `asian_high`. After a high-side sweep, project downward from `asian_low`.

These are **target estimations**, not entries. Combine with HTF DOL.

## Formula / Math

```
range_size = asian_high - asian_low

# After low-side sweep (Judas down → bullish delivery up):
proj_0_5x_up = asian_high + 0.5 * range_size
proj_1x_up   = asian_high + 1.0 * range_size
proj_1_5x_up = asian_high + 1.5 * range_size
proj_2x_up   = asian_high + 2.0 * range_size

# After high-side sweep (Judas up → bearish delivery down):
proj_0_5x_down = asian_low - 0.5 * range_size
proj_1x_down   = asian_low - 1.0 * range_size
proj_1_5x_down = asian_low - 1.5 * range_size
proj_2x_down   = asian_low - 2.0 * range_size
```

## Visual Pattern

```
   2x_up  ─────────  ← extension target
   1.5x_up ────────
   1x_up  ─────────  ← common target after Judas-down
   0.5x_up ────────
   asian_high ─────  ← sweep starts here
                /\
               /  \
              /    \   (range)
   asian_low  ─────  ← swept side
```

## Timeframes

M15 / H1 / H4 (project on whichever TF you're trading; Asian range size is small enough that M15 chart-fit works well).

## Examples

**Example 1 — bullish delivery hitting 1× projection:**
- Asian range 1.0848–1.0876, range_size = 28 pips.
- London Judas sweeps 1.0846 (low-side); HTF bullish.
- Targets:
  - 0.5×: 1.0876 + 14 = 1.0890
  - 1×: 1.0876 + 28 = 1.0904
  - 1.5×: 1.0876 + 42 = 1.0918
  - 2×: 1.0876 + 56 = 1.0932
- NY AM tags 1.0905 by 09:30, hits 1.0918 by 10:30 macro, stalls.
- → 1.5× projection delivered the daily HOD.

## Common Mistakes

- **Treating projections as primary targets.** They're estimation tools; HTF DOL (PDH/PWH/etc.) takes precedence when one of those sits closer or farther than a projection.
- **Using projections without bias.** Projections are direction-agnostic; pair with HTF bias and post-sweep displacement direction.
- **Different range definitions.** KZ-anchored range (20:00–00:00) and full-session range (18:00–03:00) produce different sizes; pick one and stick with it.

> Confidence is `medium` because the specific multiples (0.5/1/1.5/2) vary across ICT teachings; some references use 1/2/3 or fib ratios. Use as a heuristic, not a fixed rule.

A 2026 community source is a third documented variant: a diagram labels Asian-range-anchored levels using the same negative-fib-style "Standard Deviation" notation as [standard-deviation-projections](../28-fibonacci-levels/standard-deviation-projections.md) (levels drawn around −1/−2/−2.5), rather than this file's positive-multiple 0.5×/1×/1.5×/2× convention. The diagram doesn't make clear which bound (swept vs. non-swept) the levels are measured from, so **the anchor bound is not asserted here** — only that the notation-convention variance this file's own confidence hedge already anticipates has a third citable instance. Treat as a naming variant, not a fourth projection system.

**A fourth variant, from the same author's later chapter on Standard Deviation:** "Asia STD" projects the Asian range **symmetrically both above and below**, in **1–4× integer multiples of the full range** — the same mechanic as [central-bank-dealing-range](../04-time-cycles/central-bank-dealing-range.md)'s own CBDR-anchored STD system, applied to the Asian Range as anchor instead. This is neither this file's swept-side-only 0.5×/1×/1.5×/2× convention nor the −1/−2/−2.5 sign-notation variant above — a third distinct convention, not a resolution of either. Confidence stays `medium`; if anything, a fourth documented variant strengthens this file's own "multiples vary across teachings" hedge rather than retiring it.
