## Definition

The Silver Bullet rules are the operational checklist for taking an SB entry — the discipline that distinguishes a high-probability ICT setup from random fib-FVG entries during the 60-minute window. Every confirmed SB must check ALL items.

## Formal Criteria — The SB Checklist

A valid Silver Bullet entry requires ALL of:

1. **Inside one of the three SB windows** — 02:00–03:00 (London, shifted from 03:00–04:00 in 2026) / 10:00–11:00 / 14:00–15:00 NY.
2. **HTF bias direction confirmed** — long SBs only on bullish bias; shorts on bearish.
3. **Liquidity sweep occurred** — a known pool was taken (Asian range, lunch range, prior session high/low, PDH/PDL).
4. **Displacement after sweep** — strong directional candle in the bias direction.
5. **FVG formed** in or after the displacement.
6. **Entry trigger** — typically lower-TF MSS / FVG retest at CE.
7. **SL beyond the swept liquidity pool** — protects against the original sweep being followed by a continuation in that direction.
8. **Targets defined** — at minimum first SD projection or HTF DOL.

Missing any item significantly reduces conviction. Items 1–4 are non-negotiable; 5–8 can be substituted in special cases.

## Formula / Math

```
sb_entry_valid := in_sb_window
                   AND htf_bias_clear
                   AND sweep_just_occurred
                   AND displacement_after_sweep
                   AND fvg_formed
                   AND entry_trigger_present
                   AND sl_beyond_sweep
                   AND targets_defined
```

## Visual Pattern

```
   SB checklist (bullish example):

   ☐ Time inside 02-03 (LDN) / 10-11 / 14-15 NY?    [SB window]
   ☐ HTF bias bullish?                         [D / W check]
   ☐ Liquidity sweep occurred (e.g. Asian SSL or lunch low)?
   ☐ Displacement candle after sweep?
   ☐ Bullish FVG inside or after displacement?
   ☐ M5 entry trigger (FVG CE retest, MSS, etc)?
   ☐ SL beyond sweep low + small buffer?
   ☐ TP defined (SD projection / DOL)?

   All checked → take entry.
   Missing 1-4 → skip.
```

## Timeframes

M1 / M5.

## Examples

**Example 1 — checklist pass on bullish NY AM SB:**
- 10:05 NY ✓ (in window).
- HTF bullish ✓.
- 09:55 macro: M5 wicked sub-pre-NY-AM low, swept ✓.
- 10:10: 18-pip green displacement ✓.
- Bullish FVG at 1.0930-1.0934 ✓.
- 10:25: M5 retests CE 1.0932; bullish wick rejection (entry trigger) ✓.
- SL 1.0908 (sweep low - 2-pip buffer) ✓.
- TP -1.5 SD = 1.0975 ✓.
- → Take entry. Risk 24 pips, reward 43 pips → 1.8R.

## Common Mistakes

- **Skipping the sweep.** SB without a sweep beforehand is just a directional FVG entry — much lower probability.
- **No HTF check.** Bias-misaligned SBs fail at much higher rates.
- **No defined target.** SBs without a target tend to get held into reversal; pre-define TPs.
