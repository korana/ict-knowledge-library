# Silver Bullet — London

## Definition

The London Silver Bullet is the **02:00–03:00 NY** Silver Bullet window — the SB inside the London Open killzone (02:00–05:00). In 2026, ICT clarified this window shifted from 03:00-04:00 to 02:00-03:00 NY time due to liquidity provider routing changes post-MiFID III. It is typically the window where the **post-Asian-range Judas swing reverses and London's true delivery begins**. Medium probability versus the higher-probability NY AM SB, but the cleanest of the three when the Asian range is well-defined.

> **Time conflict (2026):** a same-year Thai Community source (`THAI-COMMUNITY-2026-SILVER-BULLET`) states the London Silver Bullet window as **03:00–04:00 NY** — the pre-shift time — with no mention of any MiFID III-driven shift. Its Thai-time column rules out a translation slip (บ่าย 3–4 โมง = 15:00–16:00 Thai = 03:00–04:00 NY exactly). Not adopted as a correction to the 02:00–03:00 window above — the source never addresses the shift claim, and may simply be republishing pre-2026 knowledge rather than contradicting it — but recorded as an unresolved conflict rather than silently overridden. See Citations.

## Formal Criteria

- Time window: 02:00 – 03:00 NY.
- Inside London Open killzone.
- Sequence: Asian-range sweep (often inside or just before SB window) → displacement → FVG → CE retest entry.
- Targets: Asian-range projections, PDH/PDL, HTF DOL.

## Formula / Math

```
ldn_sb_window     = [02:00, 03:00] NY
overlapping_macro = [02:50, 03:10] NY
parent_killzone   = [02:00, 05:00] NY
```

```

## Timeframes

M1 / M5.

## Examples

**Example 1 — bullish London SB:**
- HTF bullish; Asian range 1.0850–1.0875.
- 02:55 NY (macro): M5 wicks 1.0846 (Asian SSL swept), closes 1.0853.
- 03:10 NY: M5 displacement candle (16-pip green), bullish FVG at 1.0858–1.0862.
- 03:25 NY: M5 pulls back to FVG CE 1.0860. Long entry.
- SL below 1.0844 (sweep low - 2-pip buffer). Risk = 16 pips.
- Target: 1× Asian-range projection above asian_high = 1.0900 → ~40 pips → ~2.5R.

## Common Mistakes

- **Pre-window trades.** Setups firing before 02:00 are outside the formal SB window — apply SB rules with caution.
- **Counter-Asian-bias SBs.** Reading bias only from Asia (without HTF) leads to wrong-side SB entries.
