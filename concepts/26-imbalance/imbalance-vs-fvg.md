# Imbalance vs FVG — Disambiguation

## Definition

This page resolves a common terminology confusion: when ICT (and the ICT community) says **"imbalance"** vs **"Fair Value Gap (FVG)"**.

**Short version:** every FVG is an imbalance, but not every imbalance is an FVG.

- **Imbalance** = umbrella term for any region where two-sided trade didn't happen (FVGs, volume imbalances, liquidity voids — all forms of imbalance).
- **FVG** = a specific imbalance pattern: a 3-candle wick-based gap where the middle candle's range fails to overlap with the candles before and after.

Use "FVG" when you mean the specific 3-candle pattern. Use "imbalance" when you mean the broader phenomenon (or when the specific form doesn't matter).

## Formal Criteria

### Imbalance (umbrella)

- Any region of price where consecutive candles' ranges do not overlap.
- Includes: FVGs, volume imbalances, multi-candle voids.

### Fair Value Gap (specific)

- 3 candles with `L_{n+1} > H_{n-1}` (bullish) or `H_{n+1} < L_{n-1}` (bearish).
- The middle candle (n) is the displacement candle.
- The imbalance is the price region between H_{n-1} and L_{n+1} (or L_{n-1} and H_{n+1}).
- Wick-based (not body-based).

### The Containment Relationship

```
all FVGs ⊂ all imbalances
```

A volume imbalance (body-vs-body gap that doesn't satisfy the wick rule) IS an imbalance but is NOT an FVG.

## Formula / Math

```
is_imbalance(region) := consecutive_candle_ranges_dont_overlap(region)

is_FVG(n)            := is_imbalance(n)
                         AND L_{n+1} > H_{n-1}    # bullish form
                            OR H_{n+1} < L_{n-1}  # bearish form
                         AND involves_3_candles == true
```

## Visual Pattern

```
   FVG (specific 3-candle pattern):           Volume imbalance (NOT an FVG):

        ▲                                              ▲
        █  ← n+1 (low > n-1 high)                      █  ← body opens above
        █                                              █     prior body close
      ▲                                                       (no wick gap)
      █  ← n (displacement)                          ▲
      █                                              █  ← prior body
    ▲
    █  ← n-1 (high)
   wick gap = FVG                              body gap = volume imbalance
                                                (wicks may overlap; not an FVG)
```

## Timeframes

All TFs.

## Examples

**Example A — FVG and imbalance both apply:**
- M5: H_{n-1}=1.0860, L_{n+1}=1.0865.
- → 5-pip bullish FVG (specific) AND 5-pip imbalance (umbrella). Both terms valid.

**Example B — imbalance but NOT FVG:**
- M5: candle n-1 closes at 1.0855, candle n opens at 1.0860 (5-pip body gap), but wicks of n-1 (high 1.0858) and n (low 1.0856) overlap.
- → Volume imbalance (body gap), NOT an FVG (wicks overlap so the 3-candle FVG criterion fails). Calling this "FVG" is incorrect; calling it "imbalance" is correct.

## Common Mistakes

- **Calling every body gap an FVG.** Body-only gaps without the wick-non-overlap rule are volume imbalances, not FVGs.
- **Treating the terms as interchangeable.** They overlap but FVG is the stricter case. Note (2026): a Thai community source (`THAI-COMMUNITY-2026-FVG`) uses "FVG" and "Imbalance" interchangeably in casual explanation ("สำหรับผมแล้ว Fair Value Gap กับ Imbalance นั้น เหมือนกันใช้เหมือนกัน") while elsewhere in the same passage describing FVG as ICT's specific term and Imbalance as the explanatory gloss for it — closer to this page's containment relationship than to a rigorous competing claim. Not treated as `disputed`; cited here as an example of the loose usage this page's Common Mistakes section already warns about.
- **Insisting on FVGs for entries.** Volume imbalances and broader voids also qualify as ICT entry references at lower conviction.
