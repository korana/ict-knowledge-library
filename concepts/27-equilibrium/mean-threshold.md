## Definition

Mean threshold (MT) is the **50% midpoint of an order block's body** — the OB-scale equivalent of dealing-range EQ or FVG CE. ICT teaches MT as a primary entry refinement inside OBs: when price returns to a bullish OB, the long entry is taken at the OB's MT (50% of the body) rather than at the OB's far edge. MT functions as the OB's equilibrium and is one of ICT's higher-conviction entry references.

## Formal Criteria

For a bullish OB:

- The OB candle has open `O`, close `C`, high `H`, low `L`.
- Bullish OB body = the down-candle body before the bullish displacement: from `O` to `C` (where `C < O`).
- MT = `(O + C) / 2` — body midpoint.
- Some ICT references use the **full range** midpoint instead: `(H + L) / 2`. Both forms exist; the body version is more common.

For bearish OB: symmetric, body from `O` to `C` with `C > O`.

## Formula / Math

```
# Bullish OB body version:
MT_body = (open(OB_candle) + close(OB_candle)) / 2

# Full range version (sometimes used):
MT_range = (high(OB_candle) + low(OB_candle)) / 2

# By default this library uses MT_body unless stated.
```

## Visual Pattern

```
   bullish OB candle (down-close, last bearish before displacement up):

          H
          ─────
          │
          O   ← top of body
          ───── MT_body (50% of body)
          C   ← bottom of body
          │
          ─────
          L

   Long entry on retest at MT_body, SL below L (or below the FVG / breaker
   the OB anchored).
```

## Timeframes

All TFs that support OBs (M5+ generally; M1 OBs are noisy).

## Examples

**Example 1 — bullish OB MT entry:**
- H1 bullish OB candle: O=1.0830, C=1.0820, H=1.0832, L=1.0815.
- MT_body = (1.0830 + 1.0820) / 2 = 1.0825.
- HTF bullish; price returns to 1.0825.
- Long entry at MT, SL below L at 1.0812 (3-pip buffer).
- Risk = 13 pips; target PDH BSL at 1.0900 = 75 pips reward → ~5.7R setup.

## Common Mistakes

- **Confusing body MT and range MT.** Pick one and use consistently. Body MT is the more common ICT convention.
- **Entering at OB far edge instead of MT.** Far-edge entries get worse R:R and are more often skipped before MT is reached.
- **MT without confirmation.** Even at a clean MT, require post-touch confirmation (lower-TF FVG, structure shift, etc.) before commitment.
- **Treating MT as strictly higher-conviction than the OB's open price.** A 2026 community source ranks the OB candle's open price above MT in its own 3-star reference hierarchy (see [order-block-criteria](../07-order-blocks/order-block-criteria.md)) — this file's MT-as-default framing stands, but treat the two as alternative entry references rather than assuming MT always wins.
