## Definition

The London Open killzone is the 02:00 → 05:00 NY sub-window of the London session and ICT's prime morning manipulation window. The classic delivery: sweep one side of the [asian-range](../14-asian-range/asian-range.md) (Judas swing) inside the first 60 minutes, then displace in the opposite direction toward HTF DOL — the swept extreme typically becomes the day's high or low (its eventual wick) once price reverses away from it (community-attributed). This is one of the highest-volume killzones of the day — second only to London Close × NY AM overlap.

## Formal Criteria

- Time window: 02:00 → 05:00 NY (canonical NY-time anchor).
- Sits inside the London session (02:00 → 11:00 NY).
- Behavioral profile: opening manipulation move (Judas swing) → CHoCH/MSS → expansion.
- Contains the 02:50–03:10 macro time window.
- Often defines the day's HOD or LOD via the post-Judas displacement.
- **Real expansion often lags the window open by ~30 minutes (community-attributed):** a 2026 community source observes price typically doesn't begin its true directional move until roughly 02:30 NY, even though the killzone window itself opens at 02:00. That source names this instant "Open True Day" — a label already used in this wiki for the 00:00 NY daily anchor (see [true-day-open](../22-quarterly-theory/true-day-open.md)), so the name is not adopted here, only the timing observation.

## Formula / Math

```
london_open_kz = [02:00, 05:00] NY
contains_macro = [02:50, 03:10] NY
```

## Visual Pattern

```
   00:00 ─── 02:00 ─── 03:00 ─── 05:00 NY
              |          █          |
              ──── London Open KZ ──
                         ↑
              02:50–03:10 macro window
              (Judas swing typical here)
```

## Timeframes

M1 / M5 / M15. The first 30–60 minutes of the killzone (02:00–03:00) typically produce the manipulation; the next 60–90 minutes (03:00–04:30) deliver the expansion.

## Examples

**Example 1 — Judas-swing-down → bullish expansion:**
- HTF bias bullish; Asian range 1.0850–1.0880; PDH BSL at 1.0925.
- 02:30 NY: M5 wicks 1.0846 (Asian SSL swept), closes 1.0854.
- 02:55 NY: M5 displaces 18 pips up, FVG at 1.0860.
- 03:30 NY: returns to FVG, continues upward.
- 04:30 NY: takes 1.0925 PDH BSL.
- → London Open KZ delivers a textbook Judas + expansion.

## Common Mistakes

- **Entering on the manipulation move.** The first 30 minutes of LO-KZ is typically the *fake-out direction*; entering on it gets stopped before the real move.
- **Skipping the macro check.** The 02:50–03:10 macro window inside LO-KZ is the highest-density delivery moment; setups that align with the macro have higher confluence.
- **Holding past 05:00.** Post-killzone London (05:00–10:00) is mostly drift; setups that don't trigger inside the killzone usually don't deliver outside it.
