# NY AM Killzone

**Category:** 10-killzones

## Definition

The NY AM killzone is the 08:00 → 11:00 NY sub-window of the NY AM session — the **highest-volume killzone of the trading day** because of the overlap with London Close (10:00–12:00 NY). NY AM-KZ contains the 09:50–10:10 macro time and the entirety of the NY AM Silver Bullet (10:00–11:00 NY). It is typically where the daily HOD or LOD is established and where the bulk of the daily candle's body is delivered. Behaviorally it is **continuation or reversal of what London delivered** — a 2026 community source frames NY AM-KZ's two possible modes as (1) Retracement & Continue, a pause-then-resumption of the trend London's session established, or (2) Reversal against it, matching the same continuation-or-reversal duality already documented for [ny-pm-killzone](ny-pm-killzone.md) (continuation/reversal of the AM trend) and [london-session](../15-sessions/london-session.md)'s own close window (continuation/reversal of London open's move) — this file was the one gap in that otherwise-consistent pattern across sibling files.

## Formal Criteria

- Time window: 08:00 → 11:00 NY (canonical anchor).
- Sits inside NY AM session (08:00–12:00).
- Major US news embedded: 08:30 economic releases (CPI, NFP, retail sales).
- Contains macro time 09:50–10:10 NY.
- Contains NY AM Silver Bullet 10:00–11:00 NY.
- Overlaps London Close 10:00–11:00 NY (highest combined volume).

## Formula / Math

```
ny_am_kz       = [08:00, 11:00] NY
contains_macro = [09:50, 10:10] NY
contains_sb    = [10:00, 11:00] NY
overlaps_london_close = [10:00, 11:00] NY
```

                                   ↓
                              ──── NY AM Silver Bullet ────
                              10:00 – 11:00
```

## Timeframes

M1 / M5 / M15. The 08:30 news candle and the 10:00 macro/SB candles often print displacement that defines the daily range.

## Examples

**Example 1 — bullish NY AM KZ delivery:**
- HTF bias bullish; PDH BSL at 1.0925; current 1.0900.
- 08:30 NY: positive news; M5 prints 25-pip green displacement, closes 1.0922.
- 09:50–10:10 macro: pulls back to 08:30 candle's FVG, then takes 1.0925.
- 10:30 NY: extends to 1.0942 (NY AM Silver Bullet continuation).
- → NY AM KZ delivers ~40 pips, sets daily HOD.

## Common Mistakes

- **Pre-08:30 over-trading.** The pre-news window (08:00–08:30) is volatile and often produces fake breakouts that resolve only after the 08:30 release.
- **Ignoring news calendar.** NY AM has more high-impact releases than any other killzone; skipping the calendar = trading blind.
- **Treating 11:00 as a hard end.** Some NY AM setups finalize 11:00–11:30 (post-SB extension); the killzone window is a guideline, not a halt.
