# Fib vs OTE — Disambiguation

## Definition

This page resolves a frequent confusion: **fib levels** vs **OTE**.

**Short version:**
- **ICT fib levels** = the full retracement + projection set (0.50, 0.62, 0.705, 0.79 retracement; -1.5, -2.0, -2.5, -4.0 projection).
- **OTE (Optimal Trade Entry)** = the *zone* defined by the retracement subset 0.62–0.79 (centered on 0.705).

OTE is a specific use of fib levels for entry. Fib also covers projections (targets) that OTE does not directly address.

## Formal Criteria

### Fib (umbrella, ICT-specific set)

- Retracement levels: 0.50, 0.62, 0.705, 0.79.
- Projection levels: -1.5, -2.0, -2.5, -4.0.
- Used for both entries and targets.

### OTE (specific entry zone)

- Defined as the retracement zone 0.62 – 0.79.
- 0.705 is the optimal mid-point.
- 0.79 is the deep / invalidation reference.
- OTE is **only the entry side** — not the projection side.

### The Containment Relationship

```
OTE retracement zone ⊂ ICT fib retracement levels ⊂ ICT fib (umbrella)
```

The OTE zone uses three of the four ICT retracement levels (0.62, 0.705, 0.79). 0.50 (EQ) is fib but is shallower than OTE and not part of the OTE zone.

A 2026 community source states the reason classical sub-50% levels (0.236, 0.382) are absent from this set explicitly: OTE is built on the premium/discount principle, and any level shallower than equilibrium (0.50) is structurally the wrong side of the range for an entry — those two classical levels simply have no role to play in an OTE-anchored approach.

## Formula / Math

```
ict_fib_retracements = {0.50, 0.62, 0.705, 0.79}
ict_fib_projections  = {-1.5, -2.0, -2.5, -4.0}

OTE_zone             = [0.62, 0.79]
OTE_optimal          = 0.705

# 0.50 (EQ) is fib but NOT OTE.
# Projections are fib but NOT OTE.
```

## Visual Pattern

```
   ICT fib (full set):

   leg_end ────── 0.0
                                ─── -1.5 SD  ┐
                                ─── -2.0 SD  │ projections
                                ─── -2.5 SD  │ (NOT OTE)
                                ─── -4.0 SD  ┘
   ─── 0.50 (EQ) ───── (fib, NOT OTE)
   ─── 0.62 ──────── ┐
   ─── 0.705 ──────  │ OTE zone (subset)
   ─── 0.79 ──────── ┘
   leg_start ──── 1.0
```

## Timeframes

All TFs.

## Examples

**Example A — fib level used, but not OTE:**
- Price retraces to 0.50 (EQ) and finds support.
- This is a fib-level reaction, but it is NOT an OTE entry (too shallow).

**Example B — OTE entry:**
- Price retraces to 0.705 with bullish OB at the level.
- This is BOTH a fib retracement entry AND an OTE entry.

**Example C — fib used as target, not OTE:**
- Trade enters at OTE 0.705, targets -1.5 SD projection.
- The -1.5 SD is a fib projection (entry uses OTE; target uses fib projection — both are fib but only the entry is OTE).

## Common Mistakes

- **Using "fib" and "OTE" interchangeably.** OTE is the specific 0.62-0.79 entry zone; fib is broader.
- **Calling 0.50 entries "OTE."** 0.50 is EQ, not OTE. They're both fib levels but EQ is shallower.
- **Confusing OTE with classical fib zones.** OTE uses 0.62 / 0.705 / 0.79. Classical Elliott/Wyckoff zones often emphasize 0.382 / 0.500 / 0.618 — different framework.
