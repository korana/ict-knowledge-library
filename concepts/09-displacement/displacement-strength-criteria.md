## Definition

Displacement Strength Criteria are the **quality scoring** for displacement candles. Not all displacement is equal: a candle with body 90% of range and zero opposing wick is much stronger than one at 70% with a 15% wick. ICT teaches displacement scoring qualitatively as "weak / moderate / strong" — this file formalizes the criteria so setups can be calibrated by displacement quality.

## Formal Criteria

The 5-factor displacement scoring:

| Factor | Weak | Moderate | Strong |
|---|---|---|---|
| Body / range | 0.50–0.70 | 0.70–0.85 | 0.85+ |
| Opposing wick % | 20–30% | 10–20% | <10% |
| Body vs avg | 1.0–1.5× | 1.5–2× | 2×+ |
| FVG formed | small or absent | clear FVG | wide FVG inside |
| Follow-through | none | 1–2 candles continue | 3+ candles continue |

Score = sum of factor levels (1-3 each) → range 5-15.

- 5–8: weak (low conviction).
- 9–11: moderate (standard).
- 12–15: strong (highest conviction).

## Formula / Math

```
displacement_score(candle) = sum([
    body_range_score(0.50, 0.70, 0.85),
    opposing_wick_score(0.30, 0.20, 0.10),
    body_vs_avg_score(1.0, 1.5, 2.0),
    fvg_score(absent_or_small, clear, wide),
    followthrough_score(none, 1-2_candles, 3+_candles),
])

# returns 5-15
```

## Visual Pattern

```
   Weak displacement:                Strong displacement:
   
        ▲                                ▲   ← tiny wick
       ▲▲                               ▲▲
       █▲▲   ← upper wick 25%           ██
       ██   ← body 60% of range         ██   ← body 90% of range
       ██                               ██
       █                                ██
        ▲   ← lower wick                 ▲
                                         (no opposing wick)
   small/no FVG                       clear wide FVG
   no follow-through                  3+ continuation candles
```

## Timeframes

M5–D.

## Examples

**Example 1 — strong displacement scoring:**
- Body 28/32 = 87% (strong → 3).
- Upper wick 2/32 = 6% (strong → 3).
- Body 28 vs avg 8 = 3.5× (strong → 3).
- Clear FVG formed (clear → 2 — wide would be 3).
- 4 follow-up candles continued (strong → 3).
- Score = 3+3+3+2+3 = 14 → strong displacement.

## Common Mistakes

- **Single-factor scoring.** Body/range alone doesn't capture displacement quality; use all 5 factors.
- **Treating wide-but-wicked candles as strong.** A 90%-body candle with 20% upper wick is moderate, not strong.
- **Ignoring follow-through.** A "strong" displacement that immediately reverses isn't really strong — follow-through is part of the signature.
- **Treating the "Mother Bar" framing as a replacement for this scoring (2026 community source).** `THAI-COMMUNITY-2026-FVG` calls a body ≥85%/near-zero-wick candle an "Engulfing/Marubozu" candle and nests a Trading Range (Mother Bar = Inside Bar range, 50% = Equilibrium/entry) inside it — see [equilibrium-definition](../27-equilibrium/equilibrium-definition.md). That framing describes *where to enter within* a qualifying candle; it doesn't substitute for scoring *whether* the candle qualifies as strong displacement in the first place — use both together, not one instead of the other.
