## Definition

A Balanced Price Range is a price zone where a **bullish FVG and a bearish FVG overlap or share the same price region** — typically because both formed during a recent two-sided trade in the same area. ICT teaches BPR as a **decision zone**: price entering BPR can react in either direction with significant probability. Trading inside a BPR without HTF bias support is low-conviction; well-defined HTF bias is required to pick a side. BPRs often form at session highs/lows and during consolidation phases.

## Formal Criteria

A BPR exists when:

- A bullish FVG zone `[fvg_bull_low, fvg_bull_high]` and a bearish FVG zone `[fvg_bear_low, fvg_bear_high]` overlap.
- Overlap region = intersection of the two ranges.
- Both FVGs are unmitigated.
- Typically forms near range bounds during contraction / consolidation.

## Formula / Math

```
overlap = max(fvg_bull_low, fvg_bear_low), min(fvg_bull_high, fvg_bear_high)
is_bpr = overlap[0] < overlap[1]      # non-empty intersection
```

## Visual Pattern

```

   ▒▓▒▒
   ▓▓▓▓  ← BPR overlap (decision zone)

```

## Timeframes

M15+. M5 BPRs are too noisy.

## Examples

**Example 1 — H1 BPR at session high:**
- H1 bearish FVG forms at 1.0945–1.0955 after a sweep of PDH.
- Hours later, an H1 bullish FVG forms at 1.0942–1.0952 during the next push down's reversal.
- Overlap: [1.0945, 1.0952].
- HTF bearish → BPR likely resolves bearish on retest; short setup at the bearish-FVG side of BPR.

## Common Mistakes

- **Trading BPR without HTF bias.** Both directions can fire from BPR; HTF bias is the tiebreaker.
- **Calling overlapping wicks "BPR."** Both ranges must be valid 3-candle FVGs; wick-overlap alone doesn't qualify.
- **Stale BPR.** Once one of the FVGs is mitigated, the BPR character is gone — only the surviving FVG matters.
- **Reading "Inversion" as a required displacement-close event here.** A 2026 community source (`THAI-COMMUNITY-2026-FVG-TECHNIQUE`) walks through BPR formation as: an FVG forms, price sweeps liquidity beyond it, a retracement creates the opposing FVG overlapping the same zone, and it calls the older leg "the Inversion." That's a looser, descriptive use of the word — not a claim that the older FVG must first be closed-through per [inversion-fvg](inversion-fvg.md)'s stricter displacement criterion. Don't conflate the two; this file's overlap-of-two-opposing-FVGs definition stands as-is.
